Prioritize plants: Swap beef or lamb for beans, lentils, or chickpeas.
Reduce dairy: Use oat or soy milk instead of cow's milk.
Eat seasonally: Avoid produce grown in heated greenhouses or flown in from afar.
Choose ugly fruit: Buy misshapen produce to prevent it from being binned by retailers.
Limit air-freighted food: Avoid out-of-season berries or asparagus marked "produced in (distant country)."
Swap rice for grains: Opt for potatoes, pasta, or oats.
Choose sustainable seafood: Use the MSC blue label to avoid overfished stocks.
Buy in bulk: Reduce packaging waste for staples like pasta and grains.
Avoid over-processed foods: Energy-intensive factory processing adds to the footprint.
Drink tap water: Skip bottled water to eliminate plastic and transport emissions.
Plan your meals: Shop with a list to prevent impulse buying.
Understand date labels: "Best Before" is about quality; "Use By" is about safety.
Freeze leftovers: Use your freezer as a "pause button" for food near its limit.
Compost scraps: Prevent organic matter from releasing methane in a landfill.
Use "Too Good To Go": Use apps to rescue surplus food from local shops.
Monitor your bin: Identify what you throw away most and buy less of it next time.
Store food correctly: Keep potatoes in the dark and bread in the freezer to extend life.
Practice "FIFO": First In, First Out. Put new groceries at the back of the fridge.
Eat your crusts: Don’t discard edible parts of food (like broccoli stalks).
Measure portions: Use scales or cups to avoid cooking more than you can eat.
Lids on pots: Retain heat to cook faster and save energy.
Use the microwave: It is generally more energy-efficient than the oven for small meals.
Batch cook: Prepare several meals at once to maximize oven use.
Electric kettles: Only boil the exact amount of water you need.
Soak beans/pulses: Reduces the boiling time required.
Air fryers: Use these for smaller portions instead of heating a full-size oven.
One-pot meals: Fewer dishes mean less hot water used for cleaning.
Defrost naturally: Thaw food in the fridge overnight instead of using the microwave.
Keep the oven door shut: Every peek drops the temperature significantly.
Check fridge seals: Ensure your fridge isn't leaking cold air and wasting power.
